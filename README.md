# CycloneMotorMount

This is a 2D CAD model of a motor mount that I built for my Cyclone/Headway motor on my electric bicycle. This mount is superior to the one supplied by Cyclone. 

This can be fabricated by a water jet, using this drawing. 

When fabricating, produce 2 pieces; 1 at 1/4" thick, and the other at 1/8" thick.
